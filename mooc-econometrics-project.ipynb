    "## MOOC Econometrics Case Project – House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The case project focuses on modeling and predicting house prices using data from 546 residential properties. The dataset includes characteristics such as sale price, lot size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, structural features, and location indicators. The analysis aims to understand how these factors influence house prices and to construct an accurate predictive model. Linear regression and log-linear transformations are applied to examine relationships, test linearity, and improve model specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore the relationship between house characteristics and sale price.\n",
    "* Test for linearity in the regression model using the RESET test.\n",
    "* Examine whether the lot size should be included as a level or logarithmic variable.\n",
    "* Investigate interaction effects between lot size and other explanatory variables.\n",
    "* Apply a general-to-specific approach to refine the model.\n",
    "* Assess potential endogeneity issues due to omitted variables like house condition.\n",
    "* Evaluate the predictive power of the final model using out-of-sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis follows a structured approach to model and predict house prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Collected data for 546 observations including sale price, lot size, bedrooms, bathrooms, structural features, and location dummies.\n",
    "    Created new variables such as log_sell (logarithm of sale price) and log_lot (logarithm of lot size) to stabilize variance and linearize               relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Model Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Estimated a linear regression model with sale price as the dependent variable.\n",
    "  * Applied a log-linear model using the log of sale price to improve model fit.\n",
    "  * Tested inclusion of both lot size and log(lot) to determine which specification better explains house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Model Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Conducted the RESET test to check for model linearity.\n",
    "  * Evaluated statistical significance of individual coefficients and overall model fit using R-squared, t-tests, and F-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Interaction Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Created interaction terms between log_lot and other explanatory variables to capture varying effects of lot size on house prices.\n",
    "  * Tested both individual and joint significance of interactions using t-tests and F-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Applied a general-to-specific approach, iteratively removing non-significant interaction terms while keeping main effects.\n",
    "  * Ensured the final model retained only significant predictors and relevant interaction effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Predictive Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Split the data into a training set (first 400 observations) and test set (remaining 146 observations).\n",
    "  * Estimated the final model on the training set and predicted log sale prices for the test set.\n",
    "  * Measured predictive accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) relative to the standard deviation of log sale price.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Consideration of Endogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Discussed potential bias in coefficients for variables like central air due to omitted variables (e.g., house condition) affecting both house features and prices."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzed the determinants of house prices using data from 546 residential properties. Linear and log-linear regression models were applied to examine the relationships between house characteristics and sale prices, test assumptions, and develop a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linearity:** The original level model (sale price) failed the linearity test, while the log-transformed model satisfied linearity and stabilized variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lot Size:** Logarithm of lot size (log_lot) is a better predictor than raw lot size, improving model fit and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Significant Predictors:** Bedrooms, bathrooms, full bathrooms, structural style, driveway, recreation area, finished floors, garage, air conditioning, and region all significantly affect house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interaction Effects:** Only specific interactions (loglot_drv and loglot_rec) were individually significant; most interaction terms were not important, and joint tests confirmed limited collective effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Refinement:** Using the general-to-specific approach, a parsimonious model was selected that retained meaningful main effects and significant interaction terms, balancing simplicity and predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Endogeneity Consideration:** Omitted variables such as house condition may bias coefficients (e.g., effect of air conditioning may be overestimated).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predictive Accuracy:** The final model provides reasonably accurate predictions on out-of-sample data (MAE / Std Dev = 0.444), making it useful for practical price estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log-linear regression model with selected predictors and limited interaction effects effectively explains variation in house prices and provides reliable predictive ability. Transformations, careful variable selection, and awareness of potential endogeneity are crucial for robust modeling in real estate pricing analysis."
